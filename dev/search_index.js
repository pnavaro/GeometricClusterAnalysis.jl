Indeed, the number of appearance of a word in a text of a fixed number of words, written by the same author, can be modelled by a random variable of Poisson distribution. The independance between the number of appearance of the words is not realistic. However, since we do consider only some words (the 50 more frequent words), we make this approximation.
